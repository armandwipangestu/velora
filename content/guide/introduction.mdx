## What is Velora?

It's an open-source blog template, the core tech stack is using `Next.js`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Velite`, and `MDX`. With the velite, you can create a blog with type-safe data layer (because it's defined using typescript and zod for schema validation). See the velite <a className='text-[#10b981]' href="https://velite.js.org/guide/introduction" target="_blank">docs</a> for more information.

Velora just create a template for blog with some features that I need. So you don't need to create content pipeline from scratch using Velite, inside of Velora there's some pre-built components and utilities that you can use to create a blog.
