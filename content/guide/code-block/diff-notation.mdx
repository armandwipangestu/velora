# Diff Notation

Diff notation is a way to show the changes between two versions of a file, like git diff if you familiar.

## Code Example

Show diff notation using the `// [!code ++]` for added line and `// [!code --]` for removed line identifier. The identifier is place at top of the line.

````bash title="mdx" icon="iMdx" {5,9}
```ts showLineNumbers
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      //[!code --:3]
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Unchanged Line</p>

      //[!code ++]
      <h1>Hello Next.js</h1>

      <p>Highlighted Line</p>
      <p>Focused Line</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
````

It will show like this

```ts showLineNumbers
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      //[!code --:3]
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Unchanged Line</p>

      //[!code ++]
      <h1>Hello Next.js</h1>

      <p>Highlighted Line</p>
      <p>Focused Line</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
