# Focused Line

Focused line is a way to show the line that you want to focus on, when you hover the code block it will remove the blur effect.

## Code Example

Show focused line using the `// [!code focus]` identifier.

````mdx /[!code focus]/
```bash showLineNumbers
console.log("not Focused")
// [!code focus]
console.log("hover me")
console.log("not Focused")
```
````

It will show like this

```ts showLineNumbers
console.log("not Focused")
// [!code focus]
console.log("hover me")
console.log("not Focused")
```
